# Receipt Processor (NestJS)
This is the implementation of Receipt Processor API specification described here - https://github.com/fetch-rewards/receipt-processor-challenge

It's similar to the project https://github.com/shushkevich/receipt-processor , but it is built using a different tech stack (NestJS and JavaScript/TypeScript).

## Tech stack
- TypeScript
- NestJS
- MongoDB

## Highlights
- New rules can be added without changing of underlying service
- Points calculation endpoint is cached
- Added tests

## Installation
TBD
