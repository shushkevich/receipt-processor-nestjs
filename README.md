# Receipt Processor (NestJS)
This is the implementation of Receipt Processor API specification described here - https://github.com/fetch-rewards/receipt-processor-challenge

It's similar to the project https://github.com/shushkevich/receipt-processor , but it is built using a different tech stack (JavaScript/NestJS).
